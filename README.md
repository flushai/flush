## üè∑ What is Flush AI

Flush AI is an SDK for generative Image AI models, designed to help developers easily create advanced, multi-modal generative AI-driven applications. We allow developers to create 'chains', integrating various models together. Developers can chain together LLMs and any model hosted on our platform - along with our data integrations - to create multi-modal workflows between these models.

# Get Started with Flush AI
Here are a few quick steps to get Flush AI integrated into your projects.

After installing Flush AI, you can start building your chains by integrating various models. For example, here is how you can chain together LLMs like GPT-4 and Stable Diffusion XL to create a cover image for blogs.

First, let us import all the required dependencies and initialize our base models.
```python
from flushai import Chain
from flushai.models.diffusion.text2img import StableDiffusionXL
from flushai.models.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", api_key="OPENAI_API_KEY", context=story)
diffusion = StableDiffusionXL(api_key="FLUSHAI_API_KEY")
```

In a single line of code, we can define the configuration for our chain:
```python
chain = Chain(
    output = (llm, "Generate a 10 word prompt for an image diffusion model based on the story."),
_ = (diffusion, "{output}, realistic, 4k, woods")
)
```

To execute your chain, just run

```python
chain.run()
```

You can instruct GPT-4 to create different types of prompts based on your message to it. You can specify styles, the token length, subjects, or anything else and with Flush's chains, you can build a blog-cover image generator in a single line of code.
